#### Bugs during testing
   * Bug found testing style.CSS and display it properly in C9. Problem description:
      * Once a setting in the style.css was made -changes wouldn't apply to the HTMLs even after alt F5, restarting the programme,        changing class-names etc.
     * CSS had to be written in the HTML to work.
   
   * Solutions: 
     * Using a lot of Boostrap shorthand CSS in the Html:s (and somtimes also write the styles in the htmls).
     * Changing to Visual Studio.
